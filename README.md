This repository demonstrates a common ActionScript compilation error: referencing a non-existent class.  The `bug.as` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to instantiate a class that has not been defined. The `bugSolution.as` file shows how to fix the error by either defining the class or removing the reference. This is particularly relevant to larger projects where class names may be misspelled or classes might be removed accidentally.
